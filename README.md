My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 challenge.

Implementation language is Python 3. My personal goal is to write well-structured, efficient Python 3 code.

Run each puzzle like this:
```shell
PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/day01/puzzle01.py
```

Run all puzzles like this:
```shell
bash run_all.sh
```
